## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content; including links to social media and other external sources.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to interact with the site. Initiate controls and be given feedback.

     -  #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about paddleboarding in the UK.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about where in the UK are good, suitable locations to paddleboard.
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to know the requirements and equipment needed to paddleboard in the UK.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to find new locations to paddleboard as I become more experienced or have more equipment.
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to use the finder tool to help me plan my paddleboarding breaks.
        3. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to keep up to date with any social media activity relating to Sup Sup & Away!.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main background is off white #f3f0ef. The finder tool includes orange for the buttons and some backgrounds hsl(27, 88%, 66%);. Otherwise the majority of the remainder is made up of photography.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The main headings use a font called 'Ranchers' including the H1 hero and the h2 heading at the beginning of each paragraph. Its typical of the 1950s, used on posters and designed to be big - for maximum effect. I felt it worked well for a surfing feel of the site. The Montserrat font is used for the paragraphs throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   I chose photographs that either had a laid back tone or had scenes of attractive landscapes. I feel many people are drawn to Paddleboarding as it gives an opportunity to appreciate your surroundings, practicing a past-time that is slow, relaxed and meditative.

## Testing

### Manual Vs Automated Testing

- I opted to **manually** test my site.  The reasons are -  

    1. As the sole developer I can quickly carry out tests as I go and can obtain immediate results from the tests.
    2. The site I have is only one page, consisting of 10 links and the main function - the 'finder tool'.  I have devised a 10-point test process that will be carried out on multiple, most commonly used browsers and devices. It provides a very thorough, robust and comprehensive solution to ensure the site has no bugs, errors or anomalies.
    3. As the main purpose of the site is to learn Javascript, show understanding and gain a qualification; and won't need to be maintained in the long term, I felt the time it would take to build an automated testing process was unnecessary on this occasion.
    4. UX testing. Important to the overall usability of the site and can only be carried out via manual testing. Automated testing lacks human observation and cognitive abilities.

- Reasons why I would use Automated Testing in the future for other projects.

    1. Larger scale site or application that may have multiple pages and an increased amount of functionality and code. Manual testing would take too long.
    2. Working in a team. Possibly no one person with in-depth knowledge of how the whole site should work and perform. Automated tests would allow anyone to run them.
    3. Continual code added to the site. Automated tests can be ran after every addition, ensuring no disruption to the existing code.
    4. Higher accuracy. Important if the site is in the public domain and linked to an organisation. To avoid deprecation of the 'brand' due to a poor website.
    5. Time. Though they take longer to set up initially, having a bespoke automated testing process will save time in the long run, due to how frequently they need to be run when maintaining and improving the site.

### Validators

-   W3C Markup Validator complete without errors.
   <img align = "center" width ="300px" height = 200px src = "assets/images/images-testing/supsup-html-checker.jpg">

    
-   W3C CSS Validator complete without errors.
   <img align = "center"  style= width:300px; height:200px src= assets/images/images-testing/supsup-css-validator.jpg>  

-   JS Hint Javascript Validator installed and showing no errors or warnings.
    -  The validator initially gave out warnings for using ES6 declarations'let' and 'const'. Adjusting the 
  options meant the linter accepted these. see main.js ln1, col1 (esversion:6 added to options)
    - The validator gave a warning for using a Spread operator as only available since ES9. Option added to linter to ignore. see main.js ln1, col1 (esversion:9 added to options)
    - The validator gave the following warning - Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (map) (W083).  
      This is referencing the Google Map marker function. The loop is providing multiple variables so I've decided to leave this where it is.  I feel within the required scope of the site the semantics wont be an issue.  
      JS lint provide a 'relaxed' option for these types of concerns, which I've triggered.  
      See main.js ln1, col1 (loopfunc:true )

-   Lighthouse Accessability.
    - Running at a score of 98 due to background on links not having a high enough contrast.  

    <img align = "center" width ="300px" height = "200px" src = "assets/images/images-testing/supsup-testing-accessabilityfail.jpg">
    
    Updated with stronger, dark blue background to acheive 100.

### UX Manual Test process  

  - The Test  

    I enlisted the help of 5 family member.  All with varying degrees of *tech savvy-ness* if you like.  Different ages ranging from my six year old daughter to my mother (I'll spare her by not giving her age away).

    I gave them my smartphone with the site loaded up and gave one instruction and no further advice or information.

    **'Find a paddleboarding location that would be best suited to you.'**  

    I then observed them navigate the site, use the finder tool and the corresponding map to find the information.

- ##### Outcomes - 

    Though the test is a little rudimentary it provided a lot of insight, watching people unfamiliar with the site trying to use it.  
    
  * The Good  

    Everyone was successful in navigating the site to the finder tool and instigating the questionnaire.  They liked how well 'sign-posted' this was.  

    They thought the overall site was engaging and pleasantly laid out.
    
    They also liked how the locations where marked on the map and all understood these corrolate to the results.

  * The Bad

    Some didnt realise the map could be interacted with.

    Some that clicked on the map and zoomed in didnt realise they could click the marker again to zoom out. They then tried slowly zooming out.

    If zooming back out using the zoom controls of the map, the info window was still open - hiding some of the other markers.


  * Actions taken

    I added in some instruction to help with the navigation of the map.  
    <img align = "center" width = "300px" height = "200px" src = "assets/images/images-testing/supsup-testing-mapinstructions.jpg">

    I added code to remove the Info Window when zooming back out using the marker.  This allows the user to see all the result markers again allowing a subsequent selection, zooming in - then back out.  This works and feels a lot better for the user.

### 10-point Manual Test process  

I used a programme called Browserstack to perform the tests. This is software provided as part of the course, included in the Student pack.

It recommendeded that 1 x high end, 1 x low end device and a tablet is tested for each main manufacturer of smart devices.  I'll be testing Apple, Samsung, Huawei and Google.

Also I'll be testing on desktop/laptop devices, covering the main browsers used.  This ensures I've tested on a broad cross section of browsers and check functionality and responsiveness of good amount of varying devices.

Here is the devices/browsers and a screenshot of the front page of my site.  
<img align = "center" width = "300px" height = "200px" src = "assets/images/images-testing/supsup-testing-screenshots.jpg">


The 10-points are as follows -   
Links
1. Check nav bar links work. 'Contact' opens email client and 'Socials' takes you to bottom fo page.
2. The button on the hero image 'Click here for finder tool' takes you to the tool.
3. Social media icons in footer open respective site.
4. Email link in footer opens email client.

  Finder Tool  
5. Run through questions with 3 x different permitations per device.
6. Check 'Restart' button resets the tool during the questions and at result stage.
7. Check 'Next' button without selection prompts alert and doesnt affect results.
8. Check results provided match markers on map.
9. Check map marker zoom in and zoom out work and Info Window is present with URL.
10. Check URL is active and opens to external site on a new tab.
