-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main background is off white #f3f0ef. The finder tool includes orange for the buttons and some backgrounds hsl(27, 88%, 66%);. Otherwise the majority of the remainder is made up of photography.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The main headings use a font called 'Ranchers' including the H1 hero and the h2 heading at the beginning of each paragraph. Its typical of the 1950s, used on posters and designed to be big - for maximum effect. I felt it worked well for a surfing feel of the site. The Montserrat font is used for the paragraphs throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   I chose photographs that either had a laid back tone or had scenes of attractive landscapes. I feel many people are drawn to Paddleboarding as it gives an opportunity to appreciate your surroundings, practicing a past-time that is slow, relaxed and meditative.

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate the project to ensure there were no syntax errors. 


-   W3C Markup Validator complete without errors.<img src= assets/images/images-testing/supsup-html-checker.jpg style= width:200px; height:150px; float:right>

    
-   W3C CSS Validator complete without errors. <img src= assets/images/images-testing/supsup-css-validator.jpg style= width:200px; height:150px>
   

I used JS Hint and JS Lint for validating my Javascript code.  They both produced reports with no errors but some warnings.  The warning included using 'let' and 'const', arrow functions and using single quotations instead of double. I'm happy that none of the warnings will effect the site.  As a precausion I've carried out extensive brower testing to ensure my code will work.
